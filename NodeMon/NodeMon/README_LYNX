In order to Build the application:
	NodeMon

The following environment variable has to be set up:

  DIMDIR   must be set in "MakeFile_lynxXXY",

where XXY corresponds to 86x or 68m for the different 
architectures. "DIMDIR" is the main directory of the 
DIM installation. Copy the scripts "lynxProcsInfo" and
"lynxStartMon" to the lynxXXY directory.

For downloading and installing DIM, see www.cern.ch/dim.

Then do:

  make -f Makefile_lynxXXY all

NOTE 1:
The current executable for LynxOS is already in the "lynxXXY"
(XXY = 86x or 68m for the different architectures) directory.
NodeMon has been built using LynxOS 2.5.
The application must be started together with the shell script
"lynxProcsInfo". You may use the script "lynxStartMon" to start
"lynxProcsInfo" and NodeMon at the same time. For running
the application you must set the environment variable
- DIM_DNS_NODE:  node on which dim name server is running

NOTE 2:
For building DIM@GSI, the following procedure was followed.
- download DIM for unix on a linux machine
- unzip -a dim.zip (-a is very important) on a linux machine
- tar -cf dim.tar dim/ on a linux machine
- on LynxOS do the following
- get dim.tar via ftp
- tar -xf dim.tar
- us tcsh for the following
- cd dim (go to the dim directory)
- setenv OS LynxOS
- (for x86 platform only: setenv ARCH INTEL)
- source .setup
- edit the "makefile" and replace "gmake" by "make"
- then: "make CC=gcc THREADS=no SHAREABLE=no CPP=no all"
- this will build dim into the directory "lynxos".
- for different architectures it is recommended to move
  the binaries to folders like "lynxos86x" (for intel) or
  "lynxos68m" (for motorola).
(in principle it would be desirable to build dim multi-
 threaded (option: THREADS=yes). However, I did not manage
 to do this with LynxOS @ GSI.)
