Use in the \Visual folder of DIM dimVS10.sln and dimStd to compile the modified DIM dlls

Compile in Release and Win32 mode

in C/C++ -> Prep: Definitions need to include LABVIEWGSI and NDEBUG
in C/C++ -> Code: /MD
in C/C++ -> Advanced: __stdcall

Copy the DimWrapper stuff to a subfolder in \Visual and open DimWrapper.vcproj with the same options as above and:

in C/C++ -> Common: IncludeFolders: D:\Dim\dim and C:\Program Files\...\LabVIEW XXX\cintools
in Linker -> Common: Additional library folders: D:\Dim\bin and C:\Program Files\...\LabVIEW XXX\cintools
(note that the in the first step generated dlls have to be in ...\dim\bin32 !)
in Input -> Additional Dependencies: DimStd.lib (created in step 1) and labview.lib






Note that PHARLAPS is not anymore included in this library!!!!
